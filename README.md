Luke's City Sim

During the second phase of the EDA bootcamp we were tasked with creating a personal project to show to our fellow students.  There was no conditions, no criteria, no scope, and no obligations.

I decided that all I wanted to do was to challenge myself.  I wanted to try something which would take a whole lot of my brainpower to create.

I have always been somewhat facinated with traffic and the way cars interact with each other.  I had seen simulations of traffic jams which showed how and why they occurred.

So I decided to build a traffic simulation.  I really wanted to try my hand at building a pathfinding algorithm.  Plus I knew that when it was done I would be able to get great pleasure from just turning it on and letting it run.

The site is just a simple static webpage and can be viewed at https://luke-davison.github.io/city-sim/

The code quality of this project is still relatively low.  During the build process I was still discovering things about Javascript.  Sometimes when this happened I rebuilt part of the project.  Other times I just let it be.

One example is when I realised that I could have an object inside an array - and that object could have a second object as a property - and that object could have the first object as a property.  I think my mind was literally blown.  So I sat down one night and converted basically the whole infrastructure of the codebase.  Then spent a good chunk of the next day fixing the mistakes - I found 10.

The graphics came very late in the process.  I was basically done.  The cars were driving around.  They were no longer merging with each other.  Sometimes they would get stuck but I just added a simple fix whereby they just would just "give up" and go to a new destination instead when that happened.  So I was thinking about how to present the project and I found the isometric sprites.  They were so gorgious I just had to use them.

I am now done with this project.  There were still a lot of things I thought I might implement but I did not get round to.  It was fun to work on over the course of three weeks but there are so many other things I want to work on that I am leaving this as it is.
